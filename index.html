                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    I graduated with my undergraduate degree from UCSD, where I studied bioinformatics and discovered the power of computational and statistical methods in genomic analysis. To advance my career in this field, I joined Illumina, a leading sequencing company, where I applied my knowledge and skills as a software engineer to contribute to and learn from the sequencing industry. Intrigued by the science behind sequencing pipelines, I decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Computational Biology at USC to deepen my expertise and further my career. 
                    <br><p></p>When I first started my Ph.D. career, my primary research aim was to bridge two areas of study that have developed largely in isolation: DNA sequence analysis and structural biology. While sequence research emphasizes high-throughput analysis of DNA across entire genomes, structural studies provide critical 3D insights into the atomic resolution of DNA and protein (Transcription Factor) interactions, which allows us to understand molecular interaction mechanism, which is critical for develop any theraputics. From my Ph.D., I developped expertise  in conducting Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the dynamic behavior of biomolecular systems. Using this method, I am part of two published papers studying the protein-DNA system.
                    <br><p></p>Then, recent advacenment of protein structural prediction with machine learning models inspired me to incorperate these Deep Learning and Generative Models in my work. I collaborate closely with my colleagues to apply advanced deep learning tools developped in the lab for analyzing protein-DNA and protein-ligand complexes to extract structural insights from these interactions. These efforts has led to a publication in Nature Methods. Because of the confluence of these efforts, I have now turned my focus to MD-aided de novo drug design for therapeutic targets, leveraging MD simulations and Generative Models to inform and optimize the development of novel therapeutic candidates. Being at the forefront of scientific discovery and exploring the unknown has been an exhilarating experience, fostering significant personal growth and expanding my knowledge considerably.
                    <br><p></p>Lately, I have also co-produced and analyzed an X-ray crystal structure of a protein-DNA complex. I used my skillset to reveal essential molecular mechanisms and structure-function relationships. Through my MD simulations, I identified some crucial residues and formed hypothesis on how they can influence binding. My hypothesized mechanisms were subsequently validated by wet lab experiments from our collaborators, making the process of scientific hypothesis testing enlightening and gratifying for me. We will publish this paper soon.
